# My Project
My site is a satire of a high-end art gallery of someone who can sometimes take themselves too seriously with silly subjects as art. Most of the art I made myself with Photoshop with the exception of the dog collar. For that one, I just made a silly little censor in an attempt to conceal the dog's identity.
# CSS Screen Shot
I learned how to give my items more animation while simultaneously enlarging the image to give the viewers a closer look with CSS (collection.css).
